## Problem Statement
The problem at hand involves the supervised image classification of different flower species, including roses, daisies, dandelions, sunflowers, and tulips. With the abundance of beautiful and unique flowers, accurately classifying them poses a significant challenge due to visual similarities among species. However, this classification task holds great value in fields such as pharmaceuticals, botany, agriculture, and trade. The objective is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can effectively predict the flower species based on input images. By training the model on a diverse dataset encompassing various flower types, the aim is to create a reliable and accurate tool for flower classification.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for flower prediction using the flower recognition dataset consisting of five flower types: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. By employing transfer learning with ResNet-50 and implementing a Dropout layer to mitigate overfitting, we significantly improved the performance of our model. However, further improvements can be achieved by incorporating more data and employing data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. These steps will contribute to refining the accuracy and reliability of our flower classification model.
